/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the AzurePrint portfolio website.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and projects,
 * ensuring that only authenticated users can access and modify their own data.
 * Contact form submissions are restricted, and likely controlled via backend logic,
 * with the security rules acting as a secondary layer of defense.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/profile: Stores user profile information. Only the user can access their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/projects/{projectId}: Stores projects associated with a user. Only the user can access their projects.
 * - /contact_form_submissions/{submissionId}: Stores contact form submissions. Access controlled at the collection level,
 *   potentially restricted to admin roles handled by the backend.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly disallowed by the absence of a top-level /users collection.
 * - Contact form submissions are secured but likely managed by backend processes. These rules act as a secondary level of validation.
 * - The rules prioritize authorization and relational integrity, but do not enforce strict schema validation for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The data structure avoids the need for `get()` calls by nesting projects under user profiles,
 *   making ownership clear via path-based rules.
